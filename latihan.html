    <p>
    
    Autumn Leaves is a band formed in 2024, born from the simple dream of four young people who share a deep passion for music. Through meetings, rehearsals, and togetherness, we decided to build this band as a space to express ourselves and create music.<br>The band consists of four members, each with their own role: Arka as the drummer who maintains the tempo and energy of the music, Rafie as the guitarist who adds color and character to every song, Centaka as the bassist who strengthens harmony and groove, and Nazril as the vocalist who delivers stories and emotions through his voice.<br>The journey of Autumn Leaves has been filled with learning and growth. From simple practice sessions to more serious musical exploration, we gradually discovered our identity and built strong chemistry as a band. Through hard work and consistency, Autumn Leaves has also been invited several times to perform at various school events, which became valuable experiences and motivation to keep moving forward.<br>Up to this day, Autumn Leaves continues to grow and evolve. We believe that music is not only about sound, but also about togetherness, stories, and the spirit to keep creating. Autumn Leaves is here to bring colors, memories, and sounds born from our shared journey.</p>
